A dynamic, creative and curious **Full Stack Software Engineer**. 

Before learning to code at Makers Academy, I was a teaching assistant in special needs education. I became attracted to software development as an inventive medium that can be used across various industries including fashion, education and aerospace. Furthermore, I enjoy working in forward-thinking industries where I can learn new things and help those around me. 

I would love to work in a team that shares my goal of contributing to a world that we are all excited to live in. Makers engrained in me a driven nature, love of learning and sense of fun that I am eager to use to achieve this.

#### · Creative ·

During my time as a teaching assistant, supported classes in the Arts department, created presentations for my departmental seniors to deliver in meetings and planned lessons for a variety of subjects. Some of these were lessons where I covered for teachers who were off sick and unable to provide work. I also taught our high-achieving students how to write essays.

#### · Communication ·

I delivered differentiated lessons to a broad spectrum of pupils with additional needs. Pupils’ parents contacted the school to inform me that their children enjoyed my lessons as I fulfilled their needs.

#### · Practical Learning ·

I started my TA career as a volunteer and learned most of my skills through research and direct application. For my EPQ, I taught myself how to develop stories, sew, direct, co-ordinate a crew, edit and score films with an A* result.

#### · Problem-Solving ·

I liaised with my class team to develop behaviour management strategies for pupils.
