# Piper-Rose Armstrong ❀✿＊ #

A dynamic, creative and curious **Full Stack Software Engineer** freshly graduated from the Software Development Bootcamp at Makers Academy. 

Before learning to code, and during the pandemic lockdowns, I was a teaching assistant in special needs education. I became attracted to software development as an inventive medium that can be used across various industries including education, fashion and aerospace. Furthermore, I enjoy working in forward-thinking industries where I can learn new things and help those around me. 

I would love to work in a team that shares my goal of contributing to a world that we are all excited to live in. Makers engrained in me a driven nature, love of learning and sense of fun that I am eager to use to achieve this.

#### Creative

During my time as a teaching assistant, supported classes in the Arts department, created presentations for my departmental seniors to deliver in meetings and planned lessons for a variety of subjects. Some of these were lessons where I covered for teachers who were off sick and unable to provide work. I also taught our high-achieving students how to write essays. I made a 40-minute long film about giant lobsters. I created the rat theme of our final project.

#### Communication

I delivered differentiated lessons to a broad spectrum of pupils with additional needs. Pupils’ parents contacted the school to inform me that their children enjoyed my lessons as I fulfilled their needs. I did group projects at Makers. I work in a team at a busy city-centre pub where our service relies on dynamic communication.

#### Practical Learning

I started my TA career as a volunteer and learned most of my skills through research and direct application. For my EPQ, I taught myself how to develop stories, sew, direct, co-ordinate a crew, edit and score films with an A* result. I learnt multiple coding languages through applied challenges at Makers. I learnt how to waitress and bar-tend whilst on the job.

#### Problem-Solving

I liaised with my class team to develop behaviour management strategies for pupils. Whilst at Makers, I used the agile structure to break down my brief into user stories so that I could create a result using methods/techniques that I'd never used before.
