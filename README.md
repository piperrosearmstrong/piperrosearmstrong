# Piper-Rose Armstrong ❀✿＊ #

A dynamic, creative and curious **Full Stack Software Engineer** freshly graduated from the Software Development Bootcamp at Makers Academy. 

Before learning to code, and during the pandemic lockdowns, I was a teaching assistant in special needs education. I became attracted to software development as an inventive medium that can be used across various industries including education, aerospace, fashion and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, I enjoy working in forward-thinking industries where I can learn new things and help those around me. 

I would love to work in a team that shares my goal of contributing to a world that we are all excited to live in. Makers engrained in me a driven nature, love of learning and sense of fun that I am eager to use to achieve this.

#### Creative

My team made a non-realtime game for my final project at Makers Academy and I suggested the theme that we stuck with. As a teaching assistant, I planned essay-writing lessons that I taught and helped make the newsletters. Some children found Art classes difficult so I led film-making classes with them. I also taught myself how to develop stories, direct, sew and design costumes; co-ordinate a cast and crew; edit and score films for my Extended Project Qualification (EPQ). The final product, a 40-minute film called ‘The Escapades of the Eternal Damnation Crustacean’, was awarded an A* result. I’m an ideas person. Creativity makes coding exciting and enjoyable for me because you can make anything. The process of developing a program is a sequence of creative decisions. It's like choosing what kind of camera to film a moving picture on - I can choose what language to code with or how I want my product to look.

#### Strong Communication Skills

Communication was imperative for working with children with complex needs. When supporting and delivering lessons, it was my responsibility to break large pieces of information down for the children in a way which was both accessible and interesting. The children’s parents called the school to inform the head teacher that their children loved the lessons that I taught. It was rewarding when I saw this adaptive teaching style work in the wider curriculum. When my students were asked to recall the essay-writing techniques that I’d taught them in their main English classes, they each wrote perfect essays using skills that they didn’t have before, that I had taught them. Communication was also vital at Makers. For our group projects, we used the agile process and Git workflow to make sure all team members were on the same page and ensure that our group progressed seamlessly, with momentum.

#### Practical Learning

I was a volunteer when I started at All Saints School. I was then invited to apply for a part-time job and was offered a full-time position two months later by the Head Teacher. The skills I learned as a TA were ones that I picked up fulfilling my role. In my last year there, I was given a raise two times and the additional responsibility of Literacy Assistant. I supported myself by working nights at a pub whilst doing the Makers Bootcamp. Waitressing and Bartending were also new to me and have since become tasks that I enjoy doing and am proud of my performance in. At Makers, many of our projects had real-life applications and involved learning new languages whilst fulfilling a brief. For example, we learnt the MERN stack whilst building a replica of Facebook. These examples demonstrate my skill in applied learning.

#### Understanding Client Needs

Client needs have been crucial to all of the fields that I have experience in. I designed programs that met the client’s needs perfectly by breaking them down into user stories at Makers. In my role as TA for complex needs children, it was my responsibility to make pupils’ school life more enjoyable and teach them how to do the same thing for themselves. They were very varied so had different needs - some of which were mutually exclusive. Finding ways to make school feel safe for everyone was often challenging but incredibly rewarding. I love working in an environment where I help others. My dedication to improving the lives of others is important to me and is something I want to bring into my next position.

#### Effective Problem-Solving

The Bootcamp with Makers Academy operated largely around the principle that students were presented with a task involving skills we were yet to gain and we would teach ourselves the skills and languages we needed as we went. My progression in the course relied on the fact that I had solved the problems and grasped the concepts for each unit before moving on to the next. Our tutors also placed an emphasis on debugging and daily retros to improve teamwork. This taught me analytical thinking and good habits which help me unblock myself when I come across new concepts.

#### Team Leadership & Management

I enjoy leading because engaging with a variety of people to actualise a vision is immensely satisfying for me. When I made my film, I directed the logistical and creative parts. It was my responsibility to coordinate the crew and cast whilst conceptualising and actualising the design of the film. It was a very formative experience. I am comfortable with public speaking - presenting the screening of the film and also delivering lessons when working as a TA. This manifested in a few ways: commanding a physical space when covering other teachers’ lessons, managing my support staff whilst monitoring the behaviour of my students; and devising a new syllabus that had no existent framework.
