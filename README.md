# Piper-Rose Armstrong ❀✿＊ #

A dynamic, creative and curious **Full Stack Software Engineer** freshly graduated from the Software Development Bootcamp at Makers Academy. 

Before learning to code, and during the pandemic lockdowns, I was a teaching assistant in special needs education. I became attracted to software development as an inventive medium that can be used across various industries including education, aerospace, fashion and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, I enjoy working in forward-thinking industries where I can learn new things and help those around me. 

I would love to work in a team that shares my goal of contributing to a world that we are all excited to live in. Makers engrained in me a driven nature, love of learning and sense of fun that I am eager to use to achieve this.

#### Creative

For my final project at Makers Academy, my team was tasked with making a non-realtime game. I suggested we make the game theme which was the concept we stuck with. During my time as a teaching assistant, I made lesson plans for essay-writing lessons that I taught myself and helped create the newsletters. I also taught myself how to develop stories, direct, sew, co-ordinate a crew, edit and score films for my Extended Project Qualification(EPQ). The final product, a 40-minute short film called ‘The Escapades of the Eternal Damnation Crustacean’, was awarded an A* result. Some of the children at All Saints found Art classes difficult so I led separate film-making classes with them. Creativity makes coding exciting and enjoyable for me because not only can you make anything you can imagine, the process of developing a program is a sequence of creative decisions. It's much like choosing what kind of camera to film a moving picture on - I can choose what language to code with or how I want my product to look.

#### Strong Communication Skills

Working with children with complex needs, strong communication was imperative. When supporting and delivering lessons, it was my responsibility to break large pieces of information down for the children in a way to was both accessible and interesting. Some of the children’s parents called the school  to inform the head teacher that their children loved the lessons that I taught. It was rewarding when I saw this adaptive teaching style work in their other lessons. When my students were asked to recall the essay-writing techniques that I’d taught them in one of their main English lessons, they each wrote perfect essays using skills that they didn’t have before, that I had taught them. Communication was also vital at Makers. For our group projects, we used the agile process and Git workflow so making sure all team members were on the same page ensured that our group progressed seamlessly and with momentum.

#### Practical Learning

When I started at All Saints School, I was a volunteer. I then applied for a part-time job and was offered a full-time position two months later by the Head Teacher. Having a background in humanities and arts, all of the skills I learned as a TA were ones that I picked up through trial and error or from my colleagues. In my last year there, I was given a raise two times and given the additional responsibility of Literacy Assistant. This applies to my work in Hospitality too. Whilst doing the Makers Bootcamp, I supported myself by working nights at a pub. Waitressing and Bartending were also new to me to begin with and have since become tasks that I enjoy doing and am proud of my performance in. At Makers, many of our projects had real-life applications and involved learning new languages whilst fulfilling a brief. For example, we learnt MERN stack whilst building a replica of Facebook. These examples are similiar to a professional software engineering environment and demonstrate my skill in applied learning.

#### Understanding Client Needs

Client needs have been at the core of all fields that I have experience in. In hospitality, it is my responsibility to accommodate for special requests and dietary requirements. At Makers, it was my responsibility to design a program that met the client’s needs perfectly by breaking down their brief into user stories. All Saints was a complex needs school and, as TA, it was my responsibility to make pupils’ school life more enjoyable and teach them how to do the same thing for themselves. They were very varied so had different needs - some of which were mutually exclusive. Finding ways to make school feel safe for somebody who was always overstimulated and another who is under stimulated was often challenging but incredibly rewarding when achieved. I love working in an environment where I help others. My dedication to improving the lives of others is important to me and is something that I want to bring into my next position.

#### Effective Problem-Solving

The Bootcamp with Makers Academy operated largely around the principle that the course presented its students with a task involving skills we were yet to learn and in completing this task, we would also teach ourselves the skills and languages we needed. My progression in the course relied on the fact that I had solved the problems and grasped the concepts for each unit before moving on to the next. Our tutors also placed an emphasis on debugging and daily retros to improve teamwork. This taught me analytical thinking and good habits which help me unblock myself when I come across new concepts or seek support when I need it.
