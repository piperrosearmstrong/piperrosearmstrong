# Piper-Rose Armstrong ❀✿＊ #

A dynamic, creative and curious **Full Stack Software Engineer** freshly graduated from the Software Development Bootcamp at Makers Academy. 

Before learning to code, and during the pandemic lockdowns, I was a teaching assistant in special needs education. I became attracted to software development as an inventive medium that can be used across various industries including education, fashion and aerospace. Furthermore, I enjoy working in forward-thinking industries where I can learn new things and help those around me. 

I would love to work in a team that shares my goal of contributing to a world that we are all excited to live in. Makers engrained in me a driven nature, love of learning and sense of fun that I am eager to use to achieve this.

#### Creative

For my final project at Makers Academy, my team was tasked with making a non-realtime game. I suggested we make the game theme which was the concept we stuck with. During my time as a teaching assistant, I made lesson plans for essay-writing lessons that I taught myself and helped create the newsletters. I also taught myself how to develop stories, direct, sew, co-ordinate a crew, edit and score films for my Extended Project Qualification(EPQ). The final product, a 40-minute short film called ‘The Escapades of the Eternal Damnation Crustacean’, was awarded an A* result. Some of the children at All Saints found Art classes difficult so I led separate film-making classes with them. Creativity makes coding exciting and enjoyable for me because not only can you make anything you can imagine, the process of developing a program is a sequence of creative decisions. It's much like choosing what kind of camera to film a moving picture on - I can choose what language to code with or how I want my product to look.

#### Strong Communication Skills

Working with children with complex needs, strong communication was imperative. When supporting and delivering lessons, it was my responsibility to break large pieces of information down for the children in a way to was both accessible and interesting. Some of the children’s parents called the school  to inform the head teacher that their children loved the lessons that I taught. It was rewarding when I saw this adaptive teaching style work in their other lessons. When my students were asked to recall the essay-writing techniques that I’d taught them in one of their main English lessons, they each wrote perfect essays using skills that they didn’t have before, that I had taught them. Communication was also vital at Makers. For our group projects, we used the agile process and Git workflow so making sure all team members were on the same page ensured that our group progressed seamlessly and with momentum.

#### Practical Learning

I started my TA career as a volunteer and learned most of my skills through research and direct application. For my EPQ, I taught myself how to develop stories, sew, direct, co-ordinate a crew, edit and score films with an A* result. I learnt multiple coding languages through applied challenges at Makers. I learnt how to waitress and bar-tend whilst on the job.

#### Problem-Solving

I liaised with my class team to develop behaviour management strategies for pupils. Whilst at Makers, I used the agile structure to break down my brief into user stories so that I could create a result using methods/techniques that I'd never used before.
