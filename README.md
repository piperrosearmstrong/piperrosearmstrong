A dynamic, creative and curious **Full Stack Software Engineer**. 

Before learning to code at Makers Academy, I was a teaching assistant in special needs education. I became attracted to software development as an inventive medium that can be used across various industries including fashion, education and aerospace. Furthermore, I enjoy working in forward-thinking industries where I can learn new things and help those around me. 

I would love to work in a team that shares my goal of contributing to a world that we are all excited to live in. Makers engrained in me a driven nature, love of learning and sense of fun that I am eager to use to achieve this.
